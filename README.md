# The nsPCE toolbox
Methods for constructing non-smooth polynomial chaos expansion (nsPCE) surrogate models.

Codes for the nsPCE framework, applicable to non-smooth ODE models and particularly for dynamic flux balance analysis (DFBA) models, as presented in the paper:

Note that UQLab (https://www.uqlab.com/) and a DFBA integrator (e.g., https://yoric.mit.edu/software/dfbalab/how-obtain-dfbalab) must be installed in order for this code to run properly.
